// update occurs when you
// go to a cell and take his neighbors
// add a distance to the cells
// then when you get to another cell
// which have the same neighbors
// you can update the distance value of this cells





// check squares neighbord and their total distance 
// if it is not an obstacle
// go to the smallest total distance neighbord
// update the distance value of every node
// if all have higer value than the other node from the first he go back to the first
// until he reach the endpoint
